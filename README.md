# Memory Card Game

A classic memory card game built with React to practice and demonstrate React concepts including components, hooks, state management, and modern React development patterns.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This memory card game is designed as a learning project to practice React fundamentals. Players need to match pairs of cards by remembering their positions on the board. The game tracks score, moves, and time to provide an engaging user experience.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click cards to reveal and match pairs
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of moves and matches
- **Timer**: Real-time game duration tracking
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean and intuitive user interface
- **Game Reset**: Start a new game at any time
- **Win Detection**: Automatic detection when all pairs are matched

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React 18**: Modern React with latest features
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **CSS3**: Styling with modern CSS features
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript syntax and features
- **Git**: Version control

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click on any card to reveal it
2. Click on a second card to find a matching pair
3. If the cards match, they will remain visible
4. If they don't match, they will flip back after a short delay
5. Continue until all pairs are found
6. Try to complete the game with the fewest moves and fastest time!

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project serves as a practical exercise for:

- **React Components**: Creating reusable and modular components
- **React Hooks**: Using useState, useEffect, and custom hooks

- **Event Handling**: Responding to user interactions
- **Conditional Rendering**: Showing different UI based on game state
- **Props and Data Flow**: Passing data between components
- **CSS Styling**: Creating responsive and attractive designs
- **Game Logic**: Implementing game mechanics and win conditions
